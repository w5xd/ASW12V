There are four different enclosure variations archived here.
They are in three different SLDASM files.
All four variations print two pieces: a top and a bottom, and each piece has its own STL file in the STL folder.

The variations are based on the builder's choices of number of channels, and of 
whether to use screw terminals or connectors:
The enclosure mates with either of these connection designs
<ul>
    <li>screw terminal contacts (Phoenix Contact 1935200)
    <li>plug and socket connectors, the male contacts on the PCB (TE AMP 144048-6)
<ul>
Both of the above fit the same PCB hole pattern, even though the screw terminals
are 5mm spacking and the connectors are .2 inch.

The enclosure can be printed as either
<ul>
 <li>12 channel device (one PCB)
 <li>24 channel device (two PCBs and twice as big)
</ul>

The CAD models for the four resulting designs are in these (three) files:

<ul>
<li>ASW12V-single.SLDASM<br/>
12 channel device for screw terminals.
<li>ASW12V-single-connectors.SLDASM<br/>
12 channel device for connectors.
<li>ASW12V-24.SLDASM has two SolidWorks Configurations:
<ul>
<li>TwentyFour<br/>
is an enclosure for two PCBs and screw terminals.
<li>Connectors<br/>
is an enclosure for two PCBs and connectors.
</ul>
</ul>
