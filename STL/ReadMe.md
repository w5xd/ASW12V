STL models for four different enclosures. Each enclosure is a Bottom and a Top:

<ul>
<li>12 channels and screw terminals:
<ul>
<li>EnclosureTop-single.STL
<li>EnclosureBottom-single.STL
</ul>
<li>12 channels and connectors
<ul>
<li>EnclosureTop-single-connectors.STL
<li>EnclosureBottom-single-connectors.STL
</ul>
<li>24 channels and screw terminals:
<ul>
<li>EnclosureTop24.STL
<li>EnclosureBottom24.STL
</ul>
<li>24 channels and connectors:
<ul>
<li>EnclosureTop24-connectors.STL
<li>EnclosureBottom24-connectors.STL
</ul>
</ul>
TerminalBlockSpacer.STL prints a spacer that fits under the screw terminal block when 
mounted on the Rev 5 and up PCB that has the STA402 PNP darlingtons. Its of use only with the screw terminal configurations, not the ones with connectors.
